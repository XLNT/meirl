Boku is a self-soverign identity implementation using counterfactual contract identities and Gnosis Safe.

This means it:

+ has free instantiation costs; onboarding users is completely off-chain using counterfactual instantiation
  - simply, just generate a normal Ethereum keypair and then assume an identity contract exists
+ has guaranteed standard compliance via identity factories and proxy-of-proxy upgradability,
  - `[user identity] -> [ZOS centralized upgradable proxy] -> [Gnosis Safe Implementation]`
+ delegated and gasless tx using MetaTx
  - this was using Bouncer from OpenZeppelin, but in the aim of least concerns, we'll use the safe's custom signature protocol
+ uses "verifiable claims" metaphor for SSI attestations, and
  - virtual-chain style event emissions on deterministrically deployed claim registry
+ uses role based access control for key management.

In our case, the counterfactual instantiation is simply a user signing any data; this proves that they have the ability to control an identity contract, in the future, based on that public key.

When using a single key, it's possible to authenticate multiple devices using a two-factor-confirm user experience ala WalletConnect (but over a p2p network like Whisper or webp2p instead of a centralized bridge server, yeah?).

Once a user wants to evolve to caring for a fully self-sovereign identity contract (primarily to support multiple independent devices and keys beyond the single, origin key or to interact with non-ecosystem contracts), they can deploy their identity fully, which costs 66k gas, or about 5 cents at 1gwei and $450 ETH.

ENS name grants can be cached off-chain and then committed on-chain as part of the identity deploy process.

DIDs might look like

`did:xlnt-id:bytes` => `bytes.xlnt-id.eth` => `contract address`

```

[CounterfactualIdentityManager]
    v (creates)
[IdentityProxy] -> [AdminUpgradabilityProxy] -> [Identity (Gnosis Safe +)]
^ n users             ^ single, constant
^ deterministic addr  ^ deterministic addr
                      ^ upgradable via governance
```


The [deterministic address process](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/820) goes like:
1. constructing the bytecode
2. constructing the raw transaction using that bytecode and a high :originalGasPrice
  - v = `27`
  - r = `0x79BE667EF9DCBBAC55A06295CE870B07029BFCDB2DCE28D959F2815B16F81798`
  - s = `:arbitrary` (`0x0aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`)
3. recovering the signer from pseudo-signature
4. when we want to actually deploy the bytecode, send exactly :proxyGasCost * :originalGasPrice to :sender
5. then submit the signed transaction to the network, consuming all of the ether in that account

## @TODO

+ Replace counterfactual registry with ENS resolver
+ if the ENS registry isn't 820-deployed, use deterministic address proxy contract to implement `resolve()` for the specific chain.
+ add management key / transaction key / owner logic
  - we want management keys to be able to manage keys
  - we want transaction keys to be abel to send transactions
  - should those just be === gnosis safe owners with treshold of 1? probably, for simplicity
+ should keymanager be a module?
  - probably, but need to figure out how to do so
